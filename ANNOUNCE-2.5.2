* WHAT IS AFIO?

Afio is an archiver/backup program that produces cpio-format archives.

Like tar, afio can make compressed archives.  However, the compressed
archives produced by afio are much safer than tar -z archives.  If a
tar -z archive has a read error, tar is unable to extract the files
beyond this error.  The compressed archive format used by afio allows
it to recover from read errors and go on unpacking the next file.

* WHAT IS NEW IN VERSION 2.5.2?

The main changes with respect to version 2.5.1 are:

- security improvements for the handling of archives from unstrusted
  sources

- when making multivolume archives, added %V feature to include the
  volume number in subsequent volume file names

- various bug and portability fixes
