* WHAT IS AFIO?

Afio is an archiver/backup program that produces cpio-format archives.
 
Like tar, afio can make compressed archives.  However, the compressed
archives produced by afio are much safer than tar -z archives.  If a
tar -z archive has a read error, tar is unable to extract the files
beyond this error.  The compressed archive format used by afio allows
it to recover from read errors and go on unpacking the next file.

* WHAT IS NEW IN VERSION 2.5.1?

This is the first new release since 2.5 in 2003, but actually not that
much is new:

- various bug fixes

- additional options for file name filtering

- updates to the regression test scripts to make them more compatible
  with newer versions of shell tools

- additional information on the licensing status

- updated example scripts of using gpg with afio, to show a solution that
  is more compatible with (newer versions of?) gpg.
